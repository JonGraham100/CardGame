Notes about CardGame

Included Classes:
CardGame.java
Player.java
Deck.java
Card.java

I thought of this game as a simplified Blackjack game.  I kept the values of the face cards as 10 and the value of an Ace as 1.
I also kept the deck and the way it is shuffled and cut to be reminiscent of an actual deck.  I could have simplified the code
but I kept is similar to an actual blackjack game and added things that would be easy to include more players and change the
values of cards.

Once all four classes are complied, you just need to run CardGame to play the game.
CardGame will:
1. Setup a new deck
2. Shuffle and cut the deck three times
3. Create 5 players and 1 dealer
4. Deal out the cards to all players and dealer in round robin fashion
5. Compare the individual players' cards to the dealer's and determine who wins.

The output of a round will be as follows:
Player's Name:
First card player received
Second dard player received
Player's total
Dealer
First card dealer received
Second card dealer received
Dealer's total
Who the winner is
Indicator that it is moving to the next player


Example:
Player: Player 1
2 of Spades
5 of Spades
Player 1's Total:7
Player: Dealer
4 of Spades
Jack of Diamonds
Dealer's Total:14
Dealer is the Winner!
******* Next Player *******



This took me longer than an hour but I enjoyed doing it and trying to get as close to a real life card game.  I'll probably continue
with this game on my free time to get a basic blackjack game.
